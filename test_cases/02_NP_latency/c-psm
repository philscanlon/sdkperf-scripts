                    (supports CPW notation) 
    -psv=number     Configure pub send vector.  Default is 0, meaning disabled.  Max is 50
    -psm            Enable smooth publishers.  Used for latency testing.

  Subscribing options (All lists are comma separated) 
    Note: Elements of the given lists are applied round robin to clients.  Ie if you have

    -ssl=list       List of selector strings applied to filter messages from flows
    -tte=int        Number of temporary topic endpoints to create per client.

    -nsr            No subscription remove. Flag to indicate that sdkperf should
                    not remove subscriptions on exit.

  Performance measurement options.  Runtime must be > 1 second:
    -l  flag        Enable latency measurements (default is no latency). 
    -lb=int         Enable latency measurement with # buckets (default 1024
                    buckets)
    -lg=int         Latency granularity factor (default 11)
    -nagle          Enable Nagle's algorithm (RFC 896) to allow higher tcp throughput. (replaces -tnd)

  Tool Specific Options: 

    -ka=number      Keepalive interval in milliseconds.  (Default -1)
    -z=number       Enable compression. (1..9) 1 is fastest, 9 max compression.
    -epl=list       Comma sep list of extra Props passed blindly to the API

  General Parameters:
    -log=string     Set the log level.  Valid values are (debug,info,warning,
                    notice,error,critical).  Default is no logging customization.

  General Flags:
